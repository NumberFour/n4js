## N4JS

The N4JS language and its IDE enables high-quality JavaScript development for large Node.js projects. 
N4JS enriches ECMAScript with a static type system and provides extensive support for static validation hosted within a feature-rich IDE.

N4JS is based on ECMAScript Version 5 and ECMAScript 2015 is supported to a great extent. It adds a sound static type system inspired by Java 8, extended by concepts such as structural typing or union types. The language provides built-in support for state-of-the-art programming paradigms such as dependency injection and robust test support. The Eclipse based IDE for typed JavaScript is custom-built for exactly these concepts. Code is validated as you type in addition to tools such as content-assist and quick-fixes to ensure your code is written safely and intuitively.
