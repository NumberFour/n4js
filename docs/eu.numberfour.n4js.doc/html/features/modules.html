<h1>Modules</h1>
<p class="Introduction">
Large-scale projects of almost any language require good modularization for maintenance reasons.
It's vital for projects that modules don't become oversized and comprise a well-defined purpose
that is easy to comprehend for developers.<br>
The N4JS IDE helps you to keep track of your code modules and validates their usage.
</p>

<h2>Multiple Exports</h2>
<p>
While it's a good habit to assign one module for a single type, it may
be suitable to define multiple types or variables in a single module in cases where they
belong together.<br>
ES2015 allows for this with the module syntax it defines, and the good news is
that N4JS already supports most of it:
</p>

<div class="Example"><pre name="code" class="n4js:nocontrols:nogutter">export public function inc(): void { ++count; }
export public var count = 5;
export default public class Foo {
    public callOnIt(): void { }
}
</pre><div class="Example-caption">Counter.n4js</div></div>

<p>
Importing an ES2015 module and consuming exports is as easy as
</p>

<div class="Example"><pre name="code" class="n4js:nocontrols:nogutter">import { inc, count } from 'Counter';// Named imports
import Foo from 'Counter'; // Default import
import { readFile } from 'fs' // Node.js core modules
import express from 'express'; // NPM modules
import * as plainJsModule+ from 'plainJsModule'; // Dynamic import
</pre></div>

<p>
The module could be imported as a whole as well via
</p>

<div class="Example"><pre name="code" class="n4js:nocontrols:nogutter">import * as foo from 'Counter'; // Namespace import
</pre></div>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>
Anonymous default exports and relative module paths are not yet supported.
The module specifier is the relative path of the module in its source folder. Optionally the project name can be used as prefix, e.g., in case of ambiguities. 
</p>

<h2>N4JS IDE Organizes Imports</h2>

<p>
You don't have to manually write import statements, the N4JS IDE will do this automatically.
The IDE knows about all projects that are involved via the various runtime and
library dependencies that you defined in your manifest.n4mf file.
Just write the type or variable you look for and press <kbd>Ctrl+SPACE</kbd>.
The IDE will add the missing import statement for you.
</p>

<div class="Image"><a href="fig/moduleImport.gif"><img src="fig/moduleImport.gif" alt="Module Import" /></a></div>

<p>
When pasting in a code snippet, you could use <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+O</kbd>
(on Windows and Linux, <kbd>Alt+Cmd+O</kbd> on Mac) which will organize your imports, and
add any missing. This will also clean up any unused imports.
</p>


<h2>Import Removal</h2>
<p>
When developing in N4JS you may notice that you sometimes will need to import types to cast
a variable or use it for a constraint in a generic.
</p>

<div class="Example"><pre name="code" class="n4js:nocontrols:nogutter">import Foo from 'Counter';

var someOtherVar: Object;
(someOtherVar as Foo).callOnIt();

export function &lt;T extends Foo&gt; bar(t: T): void { }
</pre></div>

<p>
The compiler will notice that there's no runtime code dependency on the
imported module and will omit loading the module.
</p>

<h2>Read-only Views</h2>
<p>
ES2015 modules have the concept of read-only views. Although you cannot modify anything imported from
a module, your binding is live. For example, in the case that the exporting party has modified
the export, you will read the current value.
</p>

<div class="Example"><pre name="code" class="n4js:nocontrols:nogutter">import {inc, count} from 'Counter';

console.log(count); // 5
inc();
console.log(count); // 6
</pre></div>

<p>
Although highly discouraged, read-only views allow to support some cyclic
dependencies across modules. N4JS might even re-order type definitions to achieve this.
</p>

<h2>Loader Dirty Details</h2>
<p>
So far, there's no engine/platform that has implemented the ES2015 specification natively. N4JS
and most other transpilers transpile modules into the SystemJS format.
</p>
<p>
N4JS' output format goes a bit further and emits an unified format that works as well in a
synchronous CommonJS/Node.js environment.
Keep in mind, however, that when you load a module the CommonJS way, you are
limited to this with regard to cyclic dependencies, because it has to resolve all
dependencies synchronously.
