== Extended Features

The following features are extended features, which are not directly
available for developers. Instead, these features are only allowed for
generated code. All these features are to activated via pragma
directives for the file.

=== Redeclaration of Attributes

In general, overriding of attributes (i.e. redeclaration of attributes
in sub types) is not permitted. However, in certain cases it is possible
to redeclare an attribute yet preserve type conformance. This is
possibly if and only if the redeclared attribute’s type is type conform
to the original attribute type, and if the original attribute is
readonly.

Thus, for generated files, it is possible to enable redeclaration of
attributes via

[source]
----
JSDoc(’@pragma’ ’extended’ attributeRedeclaration?='attributeRedeclaration')?
----

The redeclaration may only be done in a sub type, defined in a
prototypes file. The redeclaration is simply done by re-defining an
attribute with the same name in the has-builder, with a different type
and probably with a different writability.

[Redeclaration Of Attributes][req:Redeclaration_Of_Attributes] If an
attribute math:[$a'$] of type math:[$T$] redeclares an
attribute math:[$a$] of a type math:[$S$], with
math:[$T.sup=S$], the following constraints must hold:

1.  The redeclaring attribute must have same name and access modifier as
the redeclared attribute: +
math:[$a'.name=a.name \land a'.acc = a.acc$]
2.  The redeclared attribute must be accessible to the type redeclaring
it: +
math:[$\alpha(a'.owner, a)$]
3.  The redeclared attribute must be readonly, in particular no setter
must have been defined: +
math:[$a.readOnly = true \land a.getSetter=null$]
4.  The type of the redeclaring attribute must be a subtype of the
redeclared attribute, or the raw types are sub types with same fields,
and methods returning subtypes and accepting super type arguments:
+
math:[$\tau(a') <: \tau(a)$] +
math:[$\lor ( $]=math:[$ \tau(a')^0 <: \tau(a)^0$] +
math:[$\land$] +
math:[$\forall\  $]=math:[$ f \in \tau(a).fields, f.acc\neq private: \exists f' \in \tau(a').fields:$] +
math:[$f'acc\leq f.acc \land f.name=f'.name \land \tau(f')=\tau(f)$] +
math:[$\land$] = +
math:[$\forall\  $]=math:[$ m \in \tau(a).methods, m.acc\neq private: \exists\ m' \in \tau(a').methods:$] +
math:[$m'.acc\leq m.acc \land m'.name=m.name \land \tau(m')<:\tau(m) \land |m'.pars|=|m.pars|$] +
math:[$\land \forall\ 0\leq i<|m'.pars|: \tau(m.pars)<:\tau(m'.pars)$] +
math:[$)$]
5.  math:[$\tau(T)\ isa\ $]

Note that the constraints are true in particular if

* The type is not changed, i.e. math:[$\tau(a') <: \tau(a)$], but
only the access modifier.
* The access modifier is not changed, but the type is changed.

=== Module Export with Type Cast

In some rare cases (see next section) the actual implementation of a
role or the sub type of an (abstract) super classes should be hidden.
While this is impossible in type expressions, it is possible to do so in
new expressions. A type needs to be required only in case of new
expressions (that is, new instances of a type should be created via ),
or in case of defining a subtype or consuming a role. Hiding a type then
actually means to use a different type name instead of the hidden one,
which means that the statement has to return a different type then the
module (name) suggests. We can use the type annotation and type cast for
that purposes.

Again, this feature (disabling some constraints specified above) has to
explicitly enabled via

[source]
----
JSDoc(’@pragma’ ’extended’ $castModuleExport$?='castModuleExport')?
----

It is then possible to add a type cast to the module.export statement as
follows:

[source]
----
module.export = N4Object.cast( Class({...}), "visible/type/Name" );
----

See next section for an example.

=== Using Extended Features for Mutable/Immutable Types

The and features allow for implementation of mutable and immutable
types. These types usually consists of three classes:

* a base role math:[$B$], which provides no methods and define only
read-only non-private attributes. All attribute types are either
** primitive types
** immutable collections or data object references. If the type argument
is a non-primitive type, they are defined with lower bound type
arguments, e.g., or
* a mutable class math:[$B\_Mutable$]
(math:[$B \in M.roles)$], in which all attributes are writeable,
and, in case of non-primitive types or collections, the type of
attributes are mutable types as well
* an immutable class math:[$B\_Immutable$]
(math:[$B \in I.roles)$], which provides some command method, in
case of non-primitive types or collections, the type of attributes are
immutable types as well
* the mutable and immutable types are defined in prototype files.
* subrole math:[$Sub$] of math:[$B$] is then consumed by
corresponding subclasses math:[$Sub\_Mutable$] (of
math:[$B\_Mutable$]) and math:[$Sub\_Immutable$] (of
math:[$B\_Immutable$]), respectively

Client code should not bother which version to use. When navigating
through fields of B, the client will usually use variables of the simple
type such as B. Instances retrieved from the server are usually
immutable, but when creating new instances via a mutable version of B is
returned.

This use case ensures the conditions specified in .

// TODO example block
// [Mutable-Imutable][ex:Mutable-Imutable]
The following example defines a
concrete type B with its mutable and immutable version. A is assumed to
be a PDO with A_Immutable and A_Imutable defined as well.

[source]
----
/**
 * @pragma extended castModuleExport
 */
module.export = NB4Object.cast(
 Role({
    has: {
        /** @type{DataObjectReference<? extends A>} */
        a   { readOnly:true },
        /** @type{ImmutableList<? extends A>} */
        as  { readOnly:true },
        /** @type{String} */
        s   { readOnly:true }
    }
}), "B_Mutable");
----

[source,n4js]
----
/**
 * @pragma extended attributeRedeclaration
 */

var /** @type{B} */ B;  // we cannot require for two reasons:
                        // 1) no require in prototypes
                        // 2) B.js exports B_Mutable!

var B_Immutable = Class({
    does: B,
    has: {
        /** @type{DataObjectReference<A_Immutable>} */
        a   { readOnly:true },
        /** @type{ImmutableList<A_Immutable>} */
        as  { readOnly:true }
    },
    methods: {
        /*
         * @type {B_Mutable}  A mutable copy of this object.
         */
        createMutableCopy: function() {},
        ...
});
----

[source]
----
/**
 * @pragma extended attributeRedeclaration
 */
var /** @type{B} */ B;

var B_Mutable = Class({
    does: B,
    has: {
        /** @type{DataObjectReference<A_Mutable>} */
        a   { readOnly:false },
        /** @type{List<A_Mutable>} */
        as  { readOnly:false },
        /** @type{String} */
        s   { readOnly:false }:
    },
    methods: {
        ...
    }
});

// TODO example block
//[Java Im/Mutable solution][ex:Java Im/Mutable solution]

The following code shows an actual working Java-version of the mutable/immutable
solution. Readonly attributes are modeled with readonly-getter,
writeable attributes have a writeable-setter. Most method bodies can be
ignored and are only added for avoiding errors and warnings.

[source,java]
----
class Do {
    static AImmutable getA()            { return new AImmutable(); }
    static AMutable   newA()            { return new AMutable(); }
    static BImmutable getB()            { return new BImmutable(); }
    static BMutable   newB()            { return new BMutable(); }

    static void foo(A a) {};
    static void bar(AImmutable ai) {};
}

class IList<IT> {
    IT get() { return null; }
}
class List<LT> extends IList<LT> {
    void add(LT t) {}
}
// some field type
interface F {}
class FImmutable implements F {}
class FMutable implements F {}
----

[source]
----
package x;

interface A {
    IList<? extends A> readonlyA();
}
class AImmutable implements A {
    @Override public IList<AImmutable> readonlyA()      { return null; }
    AMutable createMutable()                { return Do.newA(); }
}
class AMutable implements A {
    @Override public List<AMutable> readonlyA()             { return null; }
    void writeableA(List<AMutable> as)  {}
}

interface B extends A {
    IList<? extends F> readonlyF();
}
class BImmutable extends AImmutable implements B {
    @Override public IList<FImmutable> readonlyF()      { return null; }
    @Override BMutable createMutable()                  { return Do.newB(); }
}
class BMutable extends AMutable implements B {
    @Override public List<FMutable> readonlyF()             { return null; }
    void writeableF(List<FMutable> fs)  {}
}

class Demo {
    void app() {
        B b = Do.getB();
        F f = b.readonlyF().get();
        // or
        BImmutable bi = Do.getB();
        FImmutable fi = bi.readonlyF().get();
        BMutable bm = bi.createMutable();
        bm.readonlyF().add(new FMutable());

        AImmutable ai = Do.getA();
        AMutable am = ai.createMutable();
        am.readonlyA().add(bm);

        Do.foo(am);
        Do.foo(bm);
        Do.foo(bi);
        Do.foo(b);

        Do.bar(ai);
        Do.bar(bi);
    }
}
----

The override-annotations (line 21 and 25) are added to demonstrate that
it is actually possible to override here although the return type is
different. However, this is only possible due to the definition in line
18 using a wildcard. That is, defining like would cause errors in lines
21 and 25!

=== Using Type Aliases for DataObjectRef


The N4 data model defines command methods that can only be used on
specific parameterizations of the class . To allow using these commands,
we will generate a class implementing these commands for each PDO. Then
we will add a new attribute to which type is then defined with a type
alias. The following example shows how this can be used to define
commands on a :

[source]
----
/*
 * @type-param {T extends n4/model/IdentifiableDataObject}
 * @type-param {%T%RefCmds as C} The type alias to the ref commands class.
var DataObjectRef = Class({
    has: {
       /** @type {C} */
       cmds: undefined,
    }
});
var Resource = Class({
    isa: PDO
});
/**
 * Implements the command methods available on a DataObjectRef<Resource>.
 */
var ResourceRefCmds = Class({
    methods: {
        deleteResource() {};
    }
});
----

This then allows a developer to use the commands defined on the class
with the foliowing code:

[source]
----
// only one type parameter needed
// second type parameter is implicitly defined via type alias
var /** DataObjectRef<Resource> */ resourceRef;

// specific command methods can be accessed via cmdx
resourceRef.cmds.deleteResource();
----
