The N4 platform distinguishes between mutable and immutable types for
the N4 data model. Every data object (DO) in the N4 data model exists as
a mutable and an immutable type. The root class of the data object model
hierarchy is marked with the special JSDoc tag .

To distinguish both families of types in type expressions, we currently
use the same syntax as for parameterized types:

* is a type constructor that returns the immutable version of a type T.
* is a type constructor that returns the mutable version of a type T.

The type conformance for data object types latexmath:[$S$] and
latexmath:[$T$] is defined as follows:

1.  latexmath:[$S <: T =>
\\ Immutable<S> <: Immutable<T>
\\ \wedge Mutable<S> <: Mutable<T>$]
2.  latexmath:[$Immutable<T> <: T \wedge Mutable<T> <: T$]
3.  To convert an immutable object into a mutable object, special
conversion methods must be used. These methods are declared like normal
methods, but they use the the mutable and immutable type constructors in
their declaration (for an example, see ).

The operator called on a DO always returns a mutable version of the DO.

For declaring methods for latexmath:[$m$] and latexmath:[$i$],
additional JSDoc tags are used:

* marks a method for inclusion in the mutable type family
* marks a method for inclusion in the mutable type family
* on a methods allows to define an alias name for the member. In the
example below the method has as alias. Only the alias should be visible
to external developers.

[[sec:Command_Methods]]
== Command Methods


Command methods are declared for specific (generated) data model types.
Command methods on classes are declared with a special syntax for the
has attribute builder:

[source]
----
CommandMethodInClassDecl:   JSDoc(~\JSTagDef{n4.data.object.commands}~)
                            'cmd_' $group$ = CommandGroup ':' '{'
                                'init:' 'function' '('')' '{' 'return' '{'
                                    $commandMethods$ += Method*
                                    '}'
                                '}'
                            '}'
enum CommandGroup:          'batch' | 'delete' | 'other' | 'ref';
----

Command methods on classes can be declared non-static or statically
inside a builder. The following snippet shows an example:

[source]
----
        has: {


            /** @n4.data.object.commands */
            $cmd_other: {
                init: function() {
                    return {
                /**
                 * Remove (disable) a discount.
                 *
                 * @final
                 * @public
                 * @this {n4/metacompany/discounts/Discount}
                 * @return {n4/async/Promise}
                 */
                remove: function() {
----

Command methods on roles are declared differently and not inside the has
builder. They can only be declared as non-static. The following syntax
is used:

[source]
----
CommandsBlock:              'var' 'commands' '=' '{'
                                CS('cmd\_' $group$ = CommandGroup ':' '{'
                                    $commandMethods$ += Method*
                                '}')
                            '}' ';';

CommandMethodInRoleDecl:        JSDoc(~\JSTagDef{n4.data.augmentation.commands}~)
                            'module.exports.' 'cmd\_' $group$ = CommandGroup '=' 'commands' '[' '"''cmd\_' CommandGroup ']' ';'
----

This snippet shows an example:

[source]
----
var commands = {
            $cmd_other: {
                /**
                 * TODO: add documentation
                 *
                 * @final
                 * @public
                 * @this {n4/coreservices/myplace/Likeable}
                 * @return {n4/async/Promise}
                 */
                like: function() {
                    ...
                }
            }

};

/** @n4.data.augmentation.commands */
module.exports.$cmd_other = commands["$cmd_other"];
----

A command method belongs to one of the following groups:

delete::
  delete command methods
batch::
  command methods that work on command batches
ref::
  command methods that work on data object references
other::
  all other command methods

Logically there is another command method group **create**, which
contains all commands for creation of commands. But these command
methods are declared with the normal and are then annotated with so that
they are only available on mutable types.

The command methods of groups _delete_ and _other_ are available on the
mutable version of the correspondding type. For the other groups,
special pragmas are used to enable the commands methods on certain
types. The pragma enables adding command methods to the annotated type
and the pragma add the command methods of group to the annotated type.
The following example shows how to use these pragmas:

[source]
----
/**
 * @pragma metatype TypeParameterCommands
 * @pragma class commandType:$cmd_ref
 */
DataObjectRef = Class({
...
});
----

This then collects the commands of all PDO types from the corresponding
group and adds them to the annotated type.

[[sec:Static_Attributes]]
=== Class Properties


An additional JSDoc tag is used to describe class properties (static
attributes) for value object with named instances. The following syntax
is used:

[source]
----
var UnitOfLength = module.exports;
/** @n4.class.property */
UnitOfLength.KILOMETERS = UnitOfLength.my.KILOMETERS = new UnitOfLength({name:"kilometers",baseUnit:"millimeters",symbol:"km",multiplier:goog.math.Long.fromString("1000000000000")});
----

This then allows using the class properties as static attributes of the
class.

[[sec:Type_Constructors]]
== Type Constructors


We now describe how to construct mutable and immutable versions of a
data object type . These definitions are recursively defined, because a
data object type typically contains or references other data object
types.

We first define how to construct a from a data object type :

* Copy every attribute latexmath:[$a$] declared by to a new attribute
latexmath:[$a_i$] with latexmath:[$a_i.type := Immutable<a.type>$].
* Copy every command method latexmath:[$m$] from the groups and defined
for .
* Copy every method marked with and rename it if an alias is defined
with .
* Set the super type of to .
* For every consumed role latexmath:[$r$] of create a new role
latexmath:[$r_i := Immutable<r.type>$] and add it to the consumed roles
of .

We them define how to construct a from a data object type :

* Copy every attribute latexmath:[$a$] declared by to a new attribute
latexmath:[$a_i with a_i.type := Immutable<a.type> and a_i.readOnly := false$].
* Copy every method marked with and rename it if an alias is defined
with .
* Set the super type of to .
* For every consumed role latexmath:[$r$] of create a new role
latexmath:[$r_i := Mutable<r.type>$] and add it to the consumed roles of
.
