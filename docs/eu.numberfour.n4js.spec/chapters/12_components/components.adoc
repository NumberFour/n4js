== N4JS Platform Architecture

=== Overview

<<fig-cmpd_components_in_n4js,Fig. Components in N4JS>> shows the N4JS components described in detail in this
chapter.
footnote:[Note that this diagram does not necessarily reflect the actual internal implementation but only the external view.]

[[fig-cmpd_components_in_n4js]]
image::{find}fig/cmpd_components_in_n4js.png[title="N4JS Component Overview"]

The N4JS platform distinguishes several types of components. The
following components can only be created by internal developers:

[horizontal]
Runtime Environment::
  Definition of a runtime environment such as ECMAScript 5. A Runtime
  Environment describes the base types provided by the runtime directly
  which are usually globally available. Other components do not directly
  rely on runtime environments, but on runtime libraries.
Runtime Library::
  Collections of types provided by the runtime. These types may be
  extensions to certain language specifications. E.g., the ECMAScript 6
  collection classes are already provided by some environments otherwise
  only supporting ECMAScript 5. The collections are defined in terms of
  a runtime library which can then be provided by these environments.
  Runtime libraries may also contain polyfils to alter types predefined
  in the environment.
Test Environment::
  Not yet clear. Environments defined for tests
Test Library::
  Not yet clear. Libraries defined for tests supported by the to enable
  running tests and viewing test reports directly within the , such as
  __Mangelhaft__.

The following components can be created by external developers:

[horizontal]
Apps::
  User-written N4JS applications running in a web browser (the reference
  browser is Chrome).
Processors::
  User-written N4JS processors running on Node.js.
Libraries::
  User-written libraries used by apps, processors or other libraries.

These components are described in detail later.

A component is similar to a single project in the N4JS IDE. It is
shipped as <<_numberfour-archives-nfar,NFAR>> archive and contains:

[horizontal]
Manifest::
  The manifest describing the components, dependencies and metadata.
Resources::
  Resources such as images, N4ML files etc.
Sources::
  Source files of modules - actual N4JS files used in a project.
Compilation::
  Compiled, minified and concatenated versions of the N4JS files and
  other JS files.
Tests::
  Optional test sources and compiled tests.
Source Maps::
  Optional source maps.

Components contain modules. <<fig-component_content,Component Content>> describes what can be contained in a
component.

[.language-n4js]
== Component Types


Different N4JS component types are described in this section. At compile
time and runtime, dependent components have to be available.
This is the responsibility of the user interface (<<AC,IDE>> or <<AC,CLI>>) and described in the <<AC,N4IDE>> specification.

=== Apps

Applications allow developers to bundle a project as an application and
deploy it to an N4 environment. An application is visible to users of
the N4 platform in the app store. Users can subscribe and use an
application that is available in the app store.

=== Processors

Processors allow developers to bundle a project as a processor which can
run asynchronously on an N4 environment. Users can deploy a processor to
an N4 environment so that other developers can use its services.

=== Libraries

A library is a user project providing modules with declaration.

=== Runtime Environment and Runtime Libraries
task:IDE-1036[]


Runtime environments and libraries define globally available elements
(types, variables, functions) provided by the JavaScript engine. Both
must contain _only_ definition files (n4jsd) of which all elements are
marked as (`@ProvidedByRuntime`) and (`@Global`)

Other projects may refer to a _single_ runtime environment in their
manifest via `RequiredRuntimeEnvironment`  and to _multiple_ runtime libraries via `RequiredRuntimeLibraries`

Both types of components are referenced, similarly to libraries, by
their project Id. It is possible, however, to state that a specific
component may be used instead of another one via the `CompatibleWith` field defined by an environment or library.

The concrete runtime environment and library are selected by the
JavaScript engine. Deployment and execution scripts must ensure that a
component can run on the given engine; the required environments and
libraries must all be compatible with the provided environment. If no
runtime environment is specified, a default an ECMAScript 5 runtime is
assumed to be present.

Typical runtime environments are ES5 or ES6, typical runtime libraries
are DOM or HTML.

In JavaScript, browsers and other execution environments provide
built-in objects. In browsers, for example, the whole DOM is made
available via built-in object types. In this case, even the global
object also becomes a different type (in N4JS terms). Besides execution
environments such as browsers or Node.js, libraries also provide
functionality by exposing globally available functions. This is often
used to bridge execution environment inconsistencies. When browser API
differences are adapted by a library, this is called a __polyfil__.
Other adaptations, such as enabling ECMSScript 6 object types in
ECMAScript 5 environments, are known as __shim__. Instead of directly
supporting these kind of `hacks`, other components specify which
runtime environment and libraries they depend on by specifying unique
runtime ids. Possible shims (in case of environments) or polyfils (in
case of libraries) are transparently provided by the execution
environment and the bootstrap code.

=== Tests
task:IDE-1400[]


Tests are special projects which contain tests for other projects.


.Test Project
[req,id=IDE-157,version=1]
--

1.  Tests have full access to the tested project including elements with
visibility.
2.  Only other test projects can depend on tests project. In other
words, other components must not depend on test components.

In a test project, the tested projects can be specified via `testee`.
--

[.language-n4js]
== Component Content


A component is similar to a project in the N4JS IDE. It consists of
sources, test sources, resources (such as images) and libraries (nears).
These items are contained in separate folders alongside output folders
and settings specified in the manifest file. The manifest file is stored
at the root of the project (and explained in ).

For build and production purposes, other files such as `pom.xml` or
`.project` files are automatically derived from the . These files are
not to be added manually.

=== Properties


The manifest, called `manifest.n4mf`, specifies the following information:

[horizontal]
ProjectId ::
Compare to Maven pom / manifest symbolic name.

VendorId ::
This is similar to the group id in Maven.

VendorName ::
The _vendor_ of the project as a string. This is optional and if not
specified, vendor id is used as vendor name.

ProjectType ::
The _type_ of the project. The following types of projects exists:

app::
  Application
lib::
  Library
test::

api::
-
runtimeEnvironment::
  Runtime Environment
runtimeLibrary::
  Runtime Library

DeclaredVersion ::
The _version_ of the project. The version consists of a major, minor and
micro version. The syntax of the version is given by:

[source]
----
    DeclaredVersion :
        major=INT ('.' minor=INT ('.' micro=INT)?)? ('-' qualifier=ID)?
    ;

----

We use `qualifier=SNAPSHOT` in our Maven builds so that each
build uses the latest available version of a project. The qualifier is
only supported for this tooling and is removed during deployment. The
lengths of the major, minor and micro numbers is additionally limited to
four digits.

////
  %\todo[wk: micro versions]{Should we support micro versions at all?}A: Yes we should since they are part of the spec on code and data versioning.
  \todo[jr: qualifier]{Do we need support for distinction of build numbers and qualifier?}
////

[horizontal]
MainModule ::
(optional) A plain module specifier defining the project’s `main
module`. If this property is defined, other projects can import from
this project using imports where the string following keyword `from` states the
project name and not the complete module specifier (see <<import-statement-semantics,Import Statement Semantics>>).

CompatibleWith ::
In the case of a runtime environment or library, this specifies to which
other component this one is compatible to.

RequiredRuntimeEnvironment ::
Environment this project depends on. This is a simple project ID,
runtime environments are not versioned. This is usually omitted and
concrete environments are computed from the required N4JS libraries and
runtime libraries.

RequiredRuntimeLibraries ::
Comma-separated list of runtime libraries this project depends on. These
are a simple project IDs, runtime libraries are not versioned.

ProjectDependencies ::
The _dependencies_ section describes which projects this project
requires. A _dependency_ has the following properties:
+
* The __vendorId__. This is optional. If no vendor id is given, the
vendor id of the current project is also used as vendor id for this
project dependency.
* The _projectId_
* Either the minimum excluded or included version and the maximum
excluded or included version. If no version (range) is given [0.0.0,
infinity) is assumed. If only one version (e.g. 1.0) is given this is
interpreted as [1.0, infinity]. Writing (1.0) means (1.0, infinity).
* The _scope_ of the dependency. The scopes are inspired by Maven cite:[MavenDependencies] and
the following scopes are supported:

compile::
  This dependency is needed for compilation of the project _and_ it
  needs to exist on the environment when deploying it.
test::
  This dependency is only needed for compiling and running tests. _Types
  imported from a test dependency are only accessible from a test source
  fragment._
+
The deployment descriptor of a project only contains dependencies with
scope compile. If there is no scope explicitly set, the scope is set to
[compile].

Output ::
Path to output folder, compilers may use subfolders inside this folder.

Libraries ::
List of paths to libraries, that is, folders in which <<_numberfour-archives-nfar,NFARs>> are found.

Resources ::
List of paths to resources, that is, folders in which images, CSS etc.
is found.

[horizontal]
Sources ::
List of source fragments. A source fragment is a path to sources (n4js
or js), which are typically compiled to the output path, with a given
type. There exist three different source fragment types:
+
* *Source*: files, will be available in scope for projects that defines
  this project as compile time dependency. A module contained in a
  source fragment of kind _source_ can only access modules from other
  source fragments with kind source and from dependencies with scope
  compile. Files in sources will be validated and compiled to the output
  folder.
* *test*: files, will be available in scope for projects that defines this
  project as test time dependency. A module contained in a source
  fragment of kind _test_ can access any module from other source
  fragments and from dependencies with any scope. Files in sources will
  be validated and compiled to the output folder (maybe a subfolder).
* *external*: Implementation of modules defined in definition files (n4jsd). These
  implementations are never validated nor fully compiled. Instead, they
  are only wrapped into module definitions and copied to the output
  folder. See <<_external-declarations,External Declarations>> and <<_implementation-of-external-declarations,Implementation of External Declarations>> for details.


Filters for fine-tuning the validator and compiler. A filter is applied
to modules matching the given module specifier which may contain
wildcards, optionally restricted to modules defined in a specific source
path. The following filters are supported:

[horizontal]
noValidate::
Modules matching this filter are not semantically validated. That is,
they are still syntactically validated. If they are contained in
source or test source fragments, it must be possible to bind
references to declarations inside these modules. Note that switching
off validation for n4js files is disallowed.
noModuleWrap::
Files matching this filter are not wrapped into modules and they are
not semantically validated. Since they are assumed to be wrapped into
modules, declarations inside these modules cannot be referenced by
n4js code.

Optional property that defines what module loader are supported by the
modules in this component. Possible values are

[horizontal]
n4js::
(default) The modules in this component can be loaded with SystemJS or
with CommonJS.
commonjs::
Modules in this component must be loaded with CommonJS. When these
modules are referenced in generated code (i.e. when importing from
these modules), the module specifier will be prefixed with ``@@cjs/``.
node_builtin::
Modules in this component represent node built-in modules such as `fs`
or `https`. When these modules are referenced in generated code
(i.e. when importing from these modules), the module specifier will be
prefixed with `@node/`.

Validation or module-wrapping can be turned off for certain files or
folders via the manifest properties `no-validate` and
`no-module-wrapping`. While this is mostly intended for external
implementation modules below the source-external folder, it is also
allowed for `.js` and `.n4js` files in the
source folder.



.GeneralConstraints
[req,id=IDE-158,version=1]
--
1.  The projectId used in the manifest file have to match the project
name in file system as well as project name in the Eclipse workspace.
2.  There must be an output directory specified so the compiler(s) can
run.
--

.Paths
[req,id=IDE-159,version=1]
--
Paths Paths are constrained in the following way:

1.  A path cannot appear more than one time within a source fragment
type (same applies to paths in the resources section).
2.  A path cannot be used in different source fragment types at same
times.
3.  A path can only be declared exclusively in one of the sections
Output, Libraries, Resources or Sources.
4.  A path must not contain wild cards.
5.  A path has to be relative to the project path.
6.  A path has to point to folder.
7.  The folder a defined path points to must exist in the project (but
in case of non-existent folders of source fragments, only a warning is
shown). task:IDEBUG-339[]
--


.Module Specifiers
[req,id=IDE-160,version=1]
--
Module Specifiers are constrained in the following
way:

1.  Within a module filter type no duplicate specifiers are allowed.
2.  A module specifier is by default applied relatively to all defined
source containers, i.e. if there src and src2 defined as source
containers in both folders files are looked up that matches the given
module specifier
3.  A module specifier can be constrained to be applied only to a
certain source container.
4.  A module specifier is allowed to contain wildcards but it must
resolve to some existing files in the project
--

.Module Specifier Wildcard Constraints
[req,id=IDE-161,version=1]
--

. All path patterns are case sensitive.
. all module specifiers will be matched.
. all module specifiers will be matched.
. matches all module specifiers whose qualified name consists of two
segments where the first part matches test and the second part starts
with an `A` and then two more characters.
.  - matches all module specifiers whose qualified name contains a
segment that matches test and the last segment ends with an ’XYZ’.
.  A module specifier wild card isn’t allowed to contain ``pass:[***]``.
.  A module specifier wild card isn’t allowed to contain relative
navigation.
.  A module specifier wild card shouldn’t contain the file extension
(only state the file name (pattern) without extension, valid file
extensions will then be used to match the file).

== Component Dependencies


There are several dependencies between components. We can distinguish
between `require` dependencies and `provide` dependencies.
[horizontal]
require::
  _N4JS Components_ require:
* _APIs_
* _RuntimeLiberaries_ and
* _Libraries_
provide::
* _Runtime Environments_ provide _Runtime Libraries_ and maybe extend
other _Runtime Environments_ (which means they provide the same
runtime libraries as the extended environments and the same base
types).
* _SysLibs_ implement (`provide implementations` of) _APIs_

=== Runtime Environment Resolution

In order to execute (run, debug, or test) an __N4JS Component__, an
actual _runner_ has to be determined. Since runners support runtime
environments, this basically means calculating runtime environments
which provide all necessary runtime libraries needed by the component.
This is done by computing the transitive closure of required runtime
libraries and by comparing that with the transitive closure of runtime
libraries provided by an environment.


.Transitive Component Dependencies
[def]
--
We defined the following transitive closures of dependencies:

For a given N4JS Component `C` we define
////

[math]
--
 C.requiredAPIs^* & = C.requiredPIs \\
                    & \hspace{4em} \cup \\
                    & \bigcup_{L \in C.requiredLibs}C.requiredPIs^* \\
                    & \hspace{4em} \cup \\
                    & \bigcup_{S \in C.requiredAPIs}S.requiredAPIs^* \\
C.requiredLibs^*    & = C.requiredRTLibs \\
                    & \hspace{4em} \cup \\
                    & \bigcup_{L \in C.requiredLibs}L.requiredRTLibs^*
--

For a given Runtime Environment `E` we define

[math]
--

E.providedRTLibs^* & = E.providedRTLibs \\
                    & \hspace{4em} \cup \\
                    & \bigcup_{ES \in E.extendedRTEnvs} ES.E.providedRTLibs^*
--


////
--


.Runtime Environment Resolution
[req,id=IDE-162,version=1]
--
An N4JS Component `C` can be executed in an runtime environment
`E`, written as
$$E \models C$$
if the following constraints hold:

. The environment must provide all runtime libraries transitively
required by the component:
$$\forall R \in C.requiredRTLibs^*: R \in E.providedRTLibs^ *$$
+
. There exist libraries which can be executed by the environment, so
that all APIs are implemented:
+
$$\forall S \in C.requiredAPIs^*: \exists I: S \in I.implementedAPIs \land E \models I$$
--

[.language-n4js]
== Modules
task:IDE-8[]

All N4JS files are modules, sometimes also called compilation unit (CU).
This is the overall structure of a module, based on cite:[ECMA15a(S14)].

[source]
----
Script: {Script}
    annotations+=ScriptAnnotation*
    scriptElements+=ScriptElement*;

/*
 * The top level elements in a script are type declarations, exports, imports or statements
 */
ScriptElement:
      AnnotatedScriptElement
    | N4ClassDeclaration<Yield=false>
    | N4InterfaceDeclaration<Yield=false>
    | N4EnumDeclaration<Yield=false>
    | ImportDeclaration
    | ExportDeclaration
    | RootStatement<Yield=false>
;
----

Grammar and semantics of import statement is described in ; of of export
statement is described in .

task:IDE-179[]
An import statement imports a variable declaration, function
declaration, or N4 type declaration defined and exported by another
module into the current module under the given alias (which is similar
to the original name if no alias is defined). The name of the module is
its project’s source folder’s relative path without any extension, see
<<_qualified-names,Qualified Names>> for details.

This are the properties of script, which can be specified by the user:

Arbitrary annotations, see <<_annotations,Annotations>> and below for details.

The content of the script.

And we additionally define the following pseudo properties:

File system path (path delimiter is always `’/’`) relative to the source
fragment of the file without the extension. E.g.: given a source folder
`src`, `path` of a module located at:

* `src/n4/lang/List.js` is `n4/lang/List`
* `src/n4/lang/Objects.prototypes` is `n4/lang/Objects`

Pseudo property consists of the project name and project version of the
module followed by the path, the concrete syntax is: +
`<project.name>-<project.version>/<module.path>`, +
where project version includes all version parts except the qualifier. +
E.g. given a module with path `n4/lang/List` in a project `lib` with
version `1.0.0`, the `expandedPath` is
`lib-1.0.0/n4/lang/List`.

Pseudo property contains all load time dependencies of this module.

Pseudo property contains all runtime dependencies of this module.

Pseudo property contains all dependencies of this module. This is the
union of `loadtimeDeps` and `runtimeDeps` which
maintains the ordering of both lists, with the
`loadtimeDeps` at the front.

Pseudo properties to be set via annotations are explained in .

[.language-n4js]
== NumberFour Archives (NFAR)
task:IDE-19[] task:IDE-37[] task:IDE-46[]


Compiled projects are packaged in a N4 bundle archive and use `nfar` as a file extension. A nfar file is a zip archive that contains all source files,
compiled files and metadata of a project. It’s used to deploy projects
to:

* N4 environments via the N4 deployment web service
* Maven artifact repositories via the standard Maven deploy

A nfar archive has the following structure:

[horizontal]
/resources/::
  contains all resources such as images and css files
/src/::
  contains all JavaScript and N4ML source files, but doesn’t contain
  test source files.
/output/::

=== N4 Deployment Descriptor

//todo[N4 Deployment Descriptor]{Why is it needed? Where is it generated? Does it has to be changed?

The N4 deployment descriptor of a project `p` is a NFON
formatted file with the following structure:

[source]
----
{
  "@type":"n4.deployment.PackageDescription",
  "kind":~$p.deploymentKind$~, // LIBRARY, APPLICATION or PROCESSOR
  "name":~$p.name$~,
  "singleton":~$p.type="LIBRARY"$~,
  "version":~$p.version$~,
  "displayName":"",
  "buildComment":"",
  "allJavaScriptFile":~$p.allJavaScriptFile$~,
  "allMinJavaScriptFile":~$p.allMinJavaScriptFile$~,
  "dependentPackages": [
    // for (d in ~$p.dependencies$~)
    {
        "@type":"n4.deployment.DependencyInfo",
        "name": ~$d.name$~,
        "version": ~$d.version$~
    }
  ],
  "properties": {
    "@type":"n4.coreservices.graph.deployment.AppProperties",
    "objectHandlers": [
        // for (o in ~$p.objectHandlers$~)
        {
                "@type":"n4.coreservices.graph.deployment.ObjectHandler",
                "type":~$o.type$~,
                "viewId":~$o.viewId$~,
                "viewType":~$o.viewType$~,

== Properties Files

//\todo{review}

Properties files have the file extension `properties` and describe how
to localize text in a project. They basically define keys
<<_primitive-pathselector-and-i18nkey,Primitive Pathselector I18nKey>> with their
values. The key is used during runtime to retrieve text localized to the
user’s locale.

[[n4-deployment-descriptor-syntax]]
=== Syntax

The syntax of a resource file is defined as:

[source]
----
ResourceFile:   Comment* | $entry+=$ Entry*;
Comment:        '#' .* EOL;
Entry:          $key$ = KeyIdentifier '=' $value$ = .* EOL;
KeyIdentifier:  LETTER (DIGIT | LETTER | '.')*;
----


=== Constraints

Properties files have to be stored in source fragment of type source.
The _base folder_ for storing the properties files of a project
`p` is math:[$p.name\lstnfjs{/nls}$]. The
language-specific resource files are stored in subfolders of the base
folder. The base language (normally english) has to be located in a
subfolder of the base folder. The resource files for other languages
have to be located in a subfolder with the name given by syntax
**<ISO Language Code>_<ISO Country Code>**, where ISO Language Code is
given by the ISO-639 standard and ISO Country Code is given by the
ISO-3166 standard.

All resource files stored in a language folder are compiled to a
JavaScript file which exports all resource keys as an object literal.

The resource files of a project are automatically loaded. To access a
resource key `key` stored in a resource file `my.properties`, you have
to use the file name as a prefix (e.g. you have to use the key `my.key`).

== API and Implementation Components

Instead of providing an implementation, N4JS components may only define
an API by way of one or more n4jsd files which is then implemented by
separate implementation projects. For one such API project, several
implementation projects may be provided. Client code using the API will
always be bound to the API project only, i.e. only the API project will
appear in the client project’s manifest under project dependencies. When
launching the client code, the launcher will choose an appropriate
implementation for each API project in the client code’s direct or
indirect dependencies and transparently replace the API project by the
implementation project. In other words, instead of the API project’s
output folder, the implementation project’s output folder will be put on
the class path. Static compile time validations ensure that the
implementation projects comply to their corresponding API project.

Note how this concept can be seen as an alternative way of providing the
implementation for an n4jsd file: usually n4jsd files are used to define
types that are implemented in plain JavaScript code or provided by the
runtime; this concept allows for providing the implementation of an
n4jsd file in form of ordinary N4JS code.

At this time, the concept of API and implementation components is in a
prototype phase and the tool support is limited. The goal is to gain
experience from using the early prototype support and then refine the
concept over time.

Here is a summary of the most important details of this concept (they
are all subject to discussion and change):

* Support for this concept, esp. validations, should not be built into
the core language but rather implemented as a separate
validation/analysis tool. Validation is currently provided in the form
of a separate view: the API / Implementation compare view.
* A project that defines one or more other projects in its manifest
under `ImplementedProjects` is called _implementation project_. A project that has another
project pointing to itself via `ImplementedProjects` is called _API project_.
Note that, at the moment, there is no explicit definition making a project an API project.
* An implementation project must define an implementation ID in its
manifest using the `ImplementationID` property.
* For each public or public@Internal classifier or enum in an API
project, there must be a corresponding type with the same
fully-qualified name of the same or higher visibility in the
implementation project. For each member of such a type in the API, there
must exist a corresponding, owned _or_ inherited type-compatible member
in the implementation type.
* Beyond type compatibility, formal parameters should have the same name
on API and implementation side; however, different names are legal but
should be highlighted by API / Implementation tool support as a (legal)
change.
* Comments regarding the state of the API or implementation may be added
to the JSDoc in the source code using the special tag @apiNote. API /
Implementation tool support should extract and present this information
to the user in an appropriate form.
* If an API class `C` implements an interface
`I`, it has to explicitly (re-) declare all members of
`I` similar to the implementation. This is necessary for
abstract classes anyway in order to distinguish the implemented methods
from the non-implemented ones. For concrete classes, we want all members
in `C` in order to be complete and avoid problems when the
interface is changed or `C` is made abstract.

=== Execution of API and Implementation Components


When launching an N4JS component `C` under runtime
environment <<AC,RE>>, the user may(!) provide an implementation
ID math:[$I\!I\!D$] to run. Then, for each API project
`A` in the direct or indirect dependencies of
`C` an implementation project is chosen as follows:

. Collect all implementation projects for `A`
(i.e. projects that specify `A` in their manifest under `ImplementedProjects`).
. Remove implementation projects that cannot be run under runtime
environment <<AC,RE>>, using the same logic as for running
ordinary N4JS components (this step is not implemented yet!).
.  If there are no implementation projects left, show an error.
.  If math:[$I\!I\!D$] is defined (i.e. user specified an
implementation ID to run), then:
..  If there is an implementation project left with implementation ID
math:[$I\!I\!D$], use that.
..  Otherwise, show an error.
.  If math:[$I\!I\!D$] is undefined, then
..  If there is exactly 1 implementation project left, use it.
..  Otherwise, in UI mode prompt the user for a choice, in headless mode
show an error.

Having found an implementation project math:[$I_n$] for each API
project math:[$A_n$], launch as usual except that whenever
math:[$A_n$]’s output folder would be used, use math:[$I_n$]’s
output folder (esp. when constructing a `class path`) and when loading
or importing a type from math:[$A_n$] return the corresponding type
with the same fully-qualified name from math:[$I_n$].

== API and Implementation With DI

API projects may use N4JS DI (<<_dependency-injection,Dependency Injection>>) language features which require
Implementation projects to provide DI-compatible behaviour in order to
allow a Client (implemented against an API project) to be executed with
a given Implementation project. This is essential for normal execution
and for test execution. Figure <<diag_APITestsDI_Overview>> shows some of those considerations from test client point of view.

[[diag_APITestsDI_Overview]]
image::{find}fig/diag_ApiTestsDI_Overview.png[title="Overview of API tests with DI"]

Static DI mechanisms in N4JS allow an API project to enforce
Implementation projects to provide all necessary information. This
allows clients to work seamlessly with various implementations without
specific knowledge about them or without relying on extra tools for
proper project wiring. Figure <<diag_ApiTestsDI_StaticDI>> shows how API project defines project wiring and enforces certain level of testability.

[[diag_ApiTestsDI_StaticDI]]
image::{find}fig/diag_ApiTestsDI_StaticDI.png[title="API tests with static DI"]

During Client execution, weather it is test execution or not, N4JS
mechanisms will replace the API project with a proper Implementation
project. During runtime DI mechanisms will take care of providing proper
instances of implantation types.
Figure <<diag_ApiTestsDI_Views>> shows Types View perspective of the client, and Instances View perspective of the client.
