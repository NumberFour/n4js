// IMPORTANT: the following test cases are about making sure that they do not lead to a stack overflow exception!
// (the error messages are unrelated and not important here)
//


// XPECT errors --> "Object destructuring pattern cannot be applied to a value of type 'any': any is not a subtype of Object." at "{a,b}"
var {a,b} = a; // important: a appears on LHS and RHS


// FIXME re-enable this test after fixing IDE-1714

//// X--PECT errors --> "Array destructuring pattern cannot be applied to a value of type 'any': any is not a subtype of Iterable<?>." at "[x,y]"
//var [x,y] = y; // important: y appears on LHS and RHS
