// NOTE: in this test case we are not mainly interested in the type of variable 'x';
// the important thing is that we have a "semi-cyclic" forward reference to the variable
// declaration x in the expression following the 'of' keyword.

// This test is to assert that this situation does not lead to exceptions during post-processing.
