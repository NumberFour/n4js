// see https://numberfour.jira.com/browse/IDE-832

// This is due to the missing constructor: Array access doesn't work or any+ or Objects when trying to get typed members

// missed Object(@CopyOf Object x)
var bummerDeal = new Object({"party": new Object()});
//FIXED? somewhat weird error "passed null object to system at IndexedAccessExpression."
// XPECT noerrors --> 
var stuffYouKnow : Object = bummerDeal["party"];
// XPECT FIXME noerrors --> 
// GOT: Couldn't resolve reference to IdentifiableElement 'party'.
var stuffYouKnow2 : Object = bummerDeal.party;


// Jvp: the following problems seem to be fixed:

var  bummer : any+ = {"party" : "time"};
//passed null object to system at IndexedAccessExpression.
var stuff : any+ = bummer["party"];

//if you rely on automatic typing it doesn't error directly but...
var bummers = {"party" : "time"}
var stuffs = bummer["party"];
var stuffs2 = bummer.party;


//...if you try to use the value you get a 'cannot type xxx' error
if (stuffs) {
    
}

//
