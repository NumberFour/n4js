.Active Help Command Links
= Active Help Command Links

We can include some command links by inserting javascript into the HTML. The following URL
ifdef::eclipse[+++<a href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.help.aboutAction")'> opens the About dialog</a>+++]
in eclipse. I can write it more or less inline in Asciidoc.

== Formtatting

This section tests the formatting with two ifdefs side-by-side to reduce clutter in the source. The following URL
ifdef::eclipse[+++<a href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.help.aboutAction")'> opens the About dialog</a>+++ in eclipse]
ifdef::website[is where our project page is hosted: http://numberfour.github.io/n4js/.]
I can write it more or less inline in Asciidoc.
