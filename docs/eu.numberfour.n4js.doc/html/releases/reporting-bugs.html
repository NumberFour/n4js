<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1>

<p><b>We embrace bug reports and feature requests!</b></p>


<p>For the moment we use <a href="https://github.com/numberfour/n4js/issues">GitHub issues</a> to manage issues found by public users. When we will move to a different bug-tracking system, we will try to migrate these issues.
</p>
<p>
  Writing bug reports is not easy. In order to help you describing bugs and new features, the N4JS IDE comes with an extra language <a href="http://www.xpect-tests.org/">Xpect</a> especially designed to enable users of a N4JS to write good bug reports.
</p>

<h3>Write Bug Reports with Xpect</h3>
<p>With Xpect you can write concise bug reports and feature requests using N4JS and comments. What is a bug? A bug usually is a programming error that leads to unexpected behavior. What is a feature? A feature is a functionality provided by a system with a well-defined, i.e. expected, behavior. In other words: Bug reports and feature requests both have to describe the <b>expected</b> behavior. Instead of long explanations separated from the code, it is often easier to just add this <b>expectations</b> to the code.
</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows a typical feature request (on the left hand side), written with Xpect:
</p>

<div class="Image">
  <a href="fig/xpect_feature_request.png"><img src= "fig/xpect_feature_request.png"  ></a>
</div>

<p>The great thing about Xpect is that it actually defines a test. That is the feature request (or bug report) can be executed. This is even possible within the N4JS IDE, and the result is shown on the right hand side of the screenshot above. In order to do that, all you have to do is</p>

<ol>
  <li>create a new file with extension "n4js.xt" ("xt" will activate Xpect)</li>
  <li>write the bug report or feature request, using comments and the keyword "XPECT" together with a known expectation type (see below)</li>
  <li>run the Xpect test from the context menu ("Run As.../Xpect run").</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Instead of writing long explanations, just file the n4js.xt-file as bug report (and a short explanation)!</b></p>

<p>Note that in the screenshot the file does not contain any error markers -- your expectation is already taken into account during validations, improving the readability of the bug report. As shown in the screenshot above, the Xpect test failed! In order to make things easier for the developer fixing the bug, you can add an additional keyword "FIXME" to expectations you have but which are not fulfilled. In particular in longer reports with several expectations, it is very helpful to easily identify what is expected and what is correct behavior. When running the test again with the "FIXME" annotation, it will succeed as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<div class="Image">
  <a href="fig/xpect_fixme.png"><img src= "fig/xpect_fixme.png"  ></a>
</div>


<p><b>Bug reporting will be improved in future releases!</b></p>

<p>In future releases, we will improve the Xpect support and simplify writing bug reports. In particular, we will provide content assist or wizards for adding certain types of expectations. </p>

<p>In general, expectations are written inside comments preceding the line in the code which demonstrates the (un-)expected behavior, according to the following pattern:</p>

<div class="Example"><pre name="code" class="n4js:nocontrols:nogutter">// «remark» XPECT «type» FIXME --&gt; «expectation» at «location»
</pre></div>

<ol>
  <li>remark: optional and can be omitted.</li>
  <li>type: The type of the expectation is one of the types described in the table below.</li>
  <li>keyword "FIXME": is optional and is used to indicate currently missing or unexpected behavior</li>
  <li>expectation: optional, usually used for the expected issue message, or value; concrete semantic depends on the expectation type.</li>
  <li>location: used to further indicate the location of the problem, usually just the next line is assumed. The location has to be prefixed with "at" in most cases</li>
</ol>

<p>In most cases, the expectations are written on a single line. In some cases, e.g. if a single code line contains several issues, multi-line comments are to be used:</p>

<div class="Example"><pre name="code" class="n4js:nocontrols:nogutter">/* «remark» XPECT «type» ---
"expectation1" at "location1"
"expectation2" at "location2"
...
--- */
</pre></div>

<p>Depending on the type of the expectation, the syntax may be a little bit different. The following table summarizes the known types along with an example snippet to illustrate the syntax.</p>

<div class="ExampleExplanation">

  <div class="ExampleExplanation-text">

    <h3>errors</h3>

    <p>Probably the most often used expectation type, indicates a validation error to be issued.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="ExampleExplanation-code">
<div class="Example"><pre name="code" class="n4js:nocontrols:nogutter">    // XPECT errors FIXME --&gt; "float literal assigned to int"
    var i: int = 5.5;
</pre></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="ExampleExplanation">

  <div class="ExampleExplanation-text">

    <h3>warnings</h3>

    <p>Similar to "errors", indicates a validation warning to be issued.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="ExampleExplanation-code">
<div class="Example"><pre name="code" class="n4js:nocontrols:nogutter">    // XPECT warnings FIXME --&gt; "float literal assigned to int"
    var i: int = 5.5;
</pre></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="ExampleExplanation">

  <div class="ExampleExplanation-text">

    <h3>noerrors</h3>

    <p>See example above, used if no error is expected.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="ExampleExplanation-code">
<div class="Example"><pre name="code" class="n4js:nocontrols:nogutter">    var a: A;
    if (o instanceof A) {
      // I want type guards XPECT noerrors FIXME --&gt;
      a = o;
    }
</pre></div>
  </div>
</div>



    <p>More expectation types will become available in future versions.</p>
