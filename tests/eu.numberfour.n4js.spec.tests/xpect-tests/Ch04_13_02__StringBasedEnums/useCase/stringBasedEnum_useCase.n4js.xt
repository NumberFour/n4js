// NOTE:
// here we make sure that string-based enums can be used without any runtime representation;
// this means:
// 1. transpiler has to replace references to the enum's literals by corresponding string literals
// 2. transpiler has to remove the import (because nothing needs to be imported at runtime)
//
// (this tests makes sure that string-based enums do not have a runtime representation by defining it in a D-file
// for which we do not provide any implementation)
